# College Management System üéì

This repository contains a College Management System implemented in Java with MySQL database integration. The system facilitates managing students, courses, enrollments, and fees within a college environment.

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains Java source code files.
  - **`LoadingAnimation.java`**: Handles loading and exiting animations for a better user interface experience.
  - **`Display.java`**: Provides methods to display student and course-related information based on user inputs.

- **`db.properties`**: Configuration file for database connection details.

## Classes and Their Functionality üñ•Ô∏è

### `LoadingAnimation.java`

This class manages the loading and exiting animations displayed during the execution of certain tasks within the system. It includes methods like `animation()` and `exitAnimation()` which simulate loading processes using ASCII characters.

### `Display.java`

This class is responsible for displaying various types of information related to students and courses based on user input. It contains methods such as:

- **`Show(Scanner sc, Connection con)`**: Main method that interacts with the user to display different types of information such as all students in a course, student course details, complete student details, fees paid, and provides an option to exit.
  
- **Private Methods**:
  - **`displayStudentsInCourse(Scanner sc, Connection con)`**: Displays all students enrolled in a specific course based on the course ID.
  - **`displayStudentInfo(Scanner sc, Connection con)`**: Shows the course details of a specific student based on the student ID.
  - **`displayCompleteStudentDetailsById(Scanner sc, Connection con)`**: Displays comprehensive details of a student including personal information, enrollment details, and course details based on the student ID.
  - **`displayEnrollmentDataByStudentId(Scanner sc, Connection con)`**: Shows enrollment data including student name, enrollment ID, course ID, enrollment date, fees paid, and total fees based on the student ID.
